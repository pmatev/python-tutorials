1. Find the result of 10 to the 6th power

2. Find how many numbers under 10,000 are divisible by 3

3. If every character in the alphabet is assigned a number e.g. (a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.),
   what is the sum of the sentence 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'? (space = 0)

4. Write a simple program that takes asks the user to enter their name, then prints "Hello, `name`!"

5. Build a dictionary with all the numbers up to 10 like so 

```
{'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3} etc.,
```

6. Use the dictionary from step 5 to write a function like so:
```
parse("ten / two == five") # returns True
```
